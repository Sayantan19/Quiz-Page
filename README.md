# Quiz Web App
This is a WebApp solution created for holding quiz competitions on a CBT platform.<br>
It was initially developed for the Prelims Round of the TechQuiz, the Quiz Event of Technovation 2022. (Technovation is the name of our department tech fest). Now I have taken it up as a full-stack project.

<b>Tools and Languages used:</b>
<br>1. <b>Designing:</b> Basic HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap 5)
<br>2. <b>Frontend:</b> JS
<br>3. <b>API:</b> Flask
<br>4. <b>Databases:</b> SQLAlchemy, MySQL (for testing purposes).
<br>5. <b>Server:</b>: Default Flask Server.

I hope to expand this project into a comprehensive software solution for holding exams in CBT platform in schools and colleges. Ever since COVID came into effect, there has been a rise in the requirement of CBT oriented exam patterns, and I hope that I provide a solution to the same.
