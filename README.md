# Quiz-Page
This is a WebApp solution created for holding quiz competitions on a CBT platform.
I developed this initially to use the same for the Prelims Round of the TechQuiz, the Quiz Event of Technovation 2022. (Technovation is the name of our department tech fest)

Tools and Languages used:
I used basic HTML, CSS and JS for creating the same.
I used Flask for the API
I used SQLAlchemy, a flask database system, for storing the data.
I am currently using the inbuilt Flask Server for deployment.

I hope to expand this project into a comprehensive software solution for holding exams in CBT platform in schools and colleges. Ever since COVID came into effect, there has been a rise in the requirement of CBT oriented exam patterns, and I hope that I provide a cheap and easy software alternative to TCS iON.
